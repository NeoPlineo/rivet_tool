# rivet_tool

Legacy Python tool for creating and managing rivets in Autodesk Maya.

This script was originally written around 3 years ago as a single-file utility using procedural Python (no OOP, no packages). It provides a simple UI and is executed directly from Maya's Script Editor.

## Purpose

The main purpose of this repository is to:

- Preserve an old but functional Maya tool
- Practice Git and GitHub workflows
- Use this script as a base for future refactoring and improvements

## Technical Details

- Language: Python 3
- Environment: Autodesk Maya
- Structure: Single-file script
- Paradigm: Procedural (functions only)
- Execution: Maya Script Editor

## Status

Working legacy tool.  
No active refactor yet.

## Notes

This repository is intentionally simple and is being used as a learning project for version control rather than as a production-ready tool.
